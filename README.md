# BannerlordWhereTournaments
Where Tournaments adds an option to the arena menu in town to find all current tournaments without needing to have dialogue with the arena master and with no limit on the amount of tournaments listed. It also shows the prize to be won at the tournament and the amount of days left before the tournament ends.
